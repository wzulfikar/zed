Q: where's code to change chat title?
A: The main code for changing chat titles is in:
1. crates/agent_ui/src/acp/thread_view.rs:921-940 - Handles title editor events and updates the thread title when the editor buffer is edited
2. crates/agent/src/thread.rs:1796-1803 - The set_title method that actually updates the thread's title
3. crates/acp_thread/src/acp_thread.rs:1253-1258 - ACP thread's set_title method that handles the connection to set titles
The key flow is: user edits title → handle_title_editor_event → thread.set_title() → title gets updated and emitted via TitleUpdated event.
